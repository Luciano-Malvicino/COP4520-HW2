# Summary of Problem 2
i would advise the guests to choose strategy 3. The reasoning why is because it ensures fairness and would be advised when they're allowed to enter. The disadvantages would be the guests having to wait in line as well as if guests want to view multiple times they would have to wait in line multiple times. for strategy 1, it would allow guests to roam freely without having to wait inline but can lead to large crowd gatherings. for strategy 2 it would reduce congestion since there would be a sign stating the status of the showroom but guests may forget to update the sign.
